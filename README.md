# mobile-PIFM-with-easy-access
I would like to create a add-on styled program for the pifm (http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter) to allow it to be plugged into a computer (like  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbWYUFgLhSU). when the pi is plugged in it will automatically open a file on the computers desktop named something like "loaded sound's) where you could copy sounds to, which will automatically be broadcasted when the pi is receiving power(whether that be from the computer or from another power source.

the only problem with this project is that I dont know how to program (im working on it), so im leaving this project to crowdsourcing untill i can contribute. 

if you happen to find this project please help, it is a dream of mine to create a free to use and always accessible platform for people to use to create entertainment/media for themselves and others.

thank you
