# mobile-PIFM-with-easy-access
I would like to create a add-on styled program for the pifm (http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter) to allow it to be plugged into a computer (like  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbWYUFgLhSU). when the pi is plugged in it will automatically open a file on the computers desktop named something like "loaded sound's) where you could copy sounds to, which will automatically be broadcasted when the pi is receiving power(whether that be from the computer or from another power source.
